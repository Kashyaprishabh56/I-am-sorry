                            Anchu, ever since I hurted you, I haven't been able to shake this feeling of regret that twists in my gut. Words seem inadequate to express how deeply sorry I am for the pain I caused you.  There's no excuse for saying you those things, and I take full responsibility for the hurt and disappointment I brought you.  You deserve so much better than that, and it tears me up knowing I fell short.

The thought of you being upset because of me is unbearable.  You're the one who brightens my days, who makes me laugh the hardest, and who fills my life with warmth.  Dimming your light with my actions feels like a betrayal of everything you mean to me.  I never wanted to do that, (her name). You're so incredibly special, and the last thing I ever want is to be the reason behind a frown on your beautiful face.

I know a simple apology can't erase the hurt, but please believe me when I say my remorse is genuine. My love for you is real and deep, and our relationship is something I cherish more than anything else in my life.  This experience has been a harsh wake-up call, forcing me to confront my mistakes and how they impacted you.  I'm committed to learning from this and becoming a better partner who deserves your love and trust.

Right now, the most important thing to me is understanding how this affected you.  Is there anything I can do to show you how sorry I am?  Would you be willing to talk about it?  I understand if you need time, but I truly believe that open communication is the only way to repair the damage and rebuild the trust I broke.

More than anything, I want to earn back the smile that makes my heart skip a beat.  I want to be someone you can rely on, someone who listens and understands.  Let's work together, Anchu. We can overcome this obstacle and come out stronger on the other side. My love for you is unwavering, and I'm determined to prove that to you, every single day.
